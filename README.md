# Sleep-Switch
An arduino project for my CSE 321 course, where an automatic light switch cover turns lights off in empty rooms/rooms where people are sleeping to save energy.  This is code that operates a light switch cover designed following: http://www.instructables.com/id/Easy-Home-Automation-using-servo-switches/

The switch listens for noise in the room and upon not hearing noise in the room it waits for 30 minutes and then begins beeping.  The user then has 1 minute to clap or press a button that cancels the light switch off sequence.
